My First Excel Dashboard Project

I am thrilled to share my first dynamic Excel dashboard project. This was produced as part of a portfolio project under the Data Analytics bootcamp at atomcamp.
I focused on analyzing the state of schooling in Punjab, Pakistan. This project showcases my journey in data cleaning, analysis, and visualization using Excel. 

Here's a quick overview:

Scope: Schooling infrastructure and resource distribution in Punjab to provide actionable insights for policymakers.

Key Features:

1. Interactive visualizations of enrollment, school establishment trends, and resource allocation.
2. Dynamic filters for school levels, districts, and timelines.
3. Pivot table-based analysis with detailed comparisons (e.g., rural vs. urban schooling).

Process: 
1. Cleaned and organized raw data (addressing empty cells, NULL values, etc.).
2. Manipulated existing data to create new columns detailing important variables (teacher-to-student ratio, enrollment-to-classroom ratio etc.)
3. Created structured pivot tables for detailed insights.
4. Developed a visually compelling and interactive dashboard.

Please explore the Excel file. Your feedback is valuable as I continue learning and refining my skills in data analytics and dashboard design!
